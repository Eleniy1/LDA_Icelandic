Into the mysteries they will then lead us to a lake of wonder it´s might we do ponder but swiftly they drag us away through worlds and visions of sacred knowledge but the last part we must go alone them final peaks, them final hours we strive with intent to make them ours there is no other way to them golden towers within our hearts we reach for them flowers of life.

Those days have turned into weeks,Those weeks are becoming months.Those days are becoming so long.Those days go on and on.With everyday going by,My heart and soul says hi!In hope of my spirit ever to knowledge,In hope for my recovery. Maybe this day will be different,Where everything gets back to normalWhen I finally remember why. Maybe this is the dayI sit from my bed and say, yes!“Now I know, now I remember!”Its just like last September,When I was chasing my dreamsWhen I knew my means. But today is one of those days.Where my heart plays tricks,The game called hide and seek, Shame on you, peek apoo…“I cant find you, where are you?” “Use you brain.. foolwhen I'm lost, go find me!Look into your soul,If I'm lost, where would I be?” Inside I scream for helpBut with out knowing why,I close my eyes and hope for it to go by. It's just one of those days. Supriya."

He still remains a saint.Has he met another girl; fallen in love?I won't. He will always remain my dove.Christmas is way too long to wait,but I have to find out, is this fate?It can't be. I've only known him for a short while,But I can't resist that beautiful smile…I hope I will to talk to him as much as I can.The way I feel about his heart is, well, I'm a huge fan….I will do anything it takes to stay within his heart;I will die for him – as long as it doesn't keep us apart….I dream of youA stormy, dark and dreary dayand not a thing to dobut close my eyes and drift awayin fantasies of you.Behind the misty veil of sleep;beyond my heart's despair,with secret promises to keepI find you waiting there.Across the golden meadowlandand through the wooded glenwe walk together, hand in hand.We talk a bit and thenbeneath the starry summer sky;beside the crystal sea,the hero in this dreamer's lie,you give your love to me,And when it comes time to riseillusions fade away,and all is lost that satisfiesand holds my grief at bay,but in my depths the fires burn,your image locked within,awaiting still my soul's returnto love you once again."

280,280.0,"Dearest creature in creation, Study English pronunciation. I will teach you in my verse Sounds like corpse, corps, horse, and worse. I will keep you, Suzy, busy, Make your head with heat grow dizzy. Tear in eye, your dress will tear. So shall I! Oh hear my prayer. Just compare heart, beard, and heard, Dies and diet, lord and word, Sword and sward, retain and Britain. (Mind the latter, how it's written.) Now I surely will not plague you With such words as plaque and ague. But be careful how you speak: Say break and steak, but bleak and streak; Cloven, oven, how and low, Script, receipt, show, poem, and toe. Hear me say, devoid of trickery, Daughter, laughter, and Terpsichore, Typhoid, measles, topsails, aisles, Exiles, similes, and reviles; Scholar, vicar, and cigar, Solar, mica, war and far; One, anemone, Balmoral, Kitchen, lichen, laundry, laurel; Gertrude, German, wind and mind, Scene, Melpomene, mankind. Billet does not rhyme with ballet, Bouquet, wallet, mallet, chalet. Blood and flood are not like food, Nor is mould like should and would. Viscous, viscount, load and broad, Toward, to forward, to reward. And your pronunciation's OK When you correctly say croquet, Rounded, wounded, grieve and sieve, Friend and fiend, alive and live. Ivy, privy, famous; clamour And enamour rhyme with hammer. River, rival, tomb, bomb, comb, Doll and roll and some and home. Stranger does not rhyme with anger, Neither does devour with clangour. Souls but foul, haunt but aunt, Font, front, wont, want, grand, and grant, Shoes, goes, does. Now first say finger, And then singer, ginger, linger, Real, zeal, mauve, gauze, gouge and gauge, Marriage, foliage, mirage, and age. Query does not rhyme with very, Nor does fury sound like bury. Dost, lost, post and doth, cloth, loth. Job, nob, bosom, transom, oath. Though the differences seem little, We say actual but victual. Refer does not rhyme with deafer. Feoffer does, and zephyr, heifer. Mint, pint, senate and sedate; Dull, bull, and George ate late. Scenic, Arabic, Pacific, Science, conscience, scientific. Liberty, library, heave and heaven, Rachel, ache, moustache, eleven. We say hallowed, but allowed, People, leopard, towed, but vowed. Mark the differences, moreover, Between mover, cover, clover; Leeches, breeches, wise, precise, Chalice, but police and lice; Camel, constable, unstable, Principle, disciple, label. Petal, panel, and canal, Wait, surprise, plait, promise, pal. Worm and storm, chaise, chaos, chair, Senator, spectator, mayor. Tour, but our and succour, four. Gas, alas, and Arkansas. Sea, idea, Korea, area, Psalm, Maria, but malaria. Youth, south, southern, cleanse and clean. Doctrine, turpentine, marine. Compare alien with Italian, Dandelion and battalion. Sally with ally, yea, ye, Eye, I, ay, aye, whey, and key. Say aver, but ever, fever, Neither, leisure, skein, deceiver. Heron, granary, canary. Crevice and device and aerie. Face, but preface, not efface. Phlegm, phlegmatic, ass, glass, bass. Large, but target, gin, give, verging, Ought, out, joust and scour, scourging. Ear, but earn and wear and tear Do not rhyme with here but ere. Seven is right, but so is even, Hyphen, roughen, nephew Stephen, Monkey, donkey, Turk and jerk, Ask, grasp, wasp, and cork and work. Pronunciation – think of Psyche! Is a paling stout and spikey? Won't it make you lose your wits, Writing groats and saying grits? It's a dark abyss or tunnel: Strewn with stones, stowed, solace, gunwale, Islington and Isle of Wight, Housewife, verdict and indict. Finally, which rhymes with enough – Though, through, plough, or dough, or cough? Hiccough has the sound of cup. My advice is to give up!!! Have a nice day"

I´ve got oceans of thatMy white doves flee as the black crows apear and the volture´s attack, The tides are closing in, my eyes are noticeingThat there´s a thin line betwean life and death and the line is getting ultra thinFinally I´ll drown my sorrow, wash away the regretsLay the ghost´s of my past to sleep they´ll rest their eyes in the seabedNo more tears to shead, doomed for eternal sleep so I cross my armsTo think this all could of been prevented if I only had a schoulder to cry on."

I need to get out, I need to be free, but where do you go when you cant see? How do you flee when you've nowhere to be?I have so many words to say, but nothing is gained, so many demons to slay, but still I've refrained. Every day I run away, but still I am chained, choosing to imprison myself for fear of……the opposite of success,making a mess of living, the stress of giving my all, standing tall with nothing to break the inevitable fall of me. Striving to see through eye's that cannot disguise the pain of facing the truth, the loss of youth and with it my dreams fall apart at the seams and are scattered by the whispers of men carrying the unheard promise of……love.As I fall through the occupied space in your head, as I stitch together wounds that have already bled, I testify on behalf of severed hearts and other broken parts, and the rivers of tears that have already been shed, that love is what they shove down your throat, and wear like a coat to get what they need. What do you need, baby, what are you needing? My bleeding heart that you ripped apart for another trophy in your shopping cart. What makes you tick? You just needed me to lick your dick and now I'm sad ‘cause you succeeded.I am truly blown away by another days decay, but I can no longer milk the self involved, self pitying tear from the well of my self inflicted fear. My over zealous attire is nothing to admire ’cause my over indulgent mind is masquerading as the match that lit the fire when really I'm just a consumer, a buyer of other peoples make believe. I create only words which cant be worn, eaten, or born in a world where ideals are so readily torn. In a world where love is corn on the cob, a fast and easy sob story.Boy meets girl.Girl makes boys cock curl in delight, it's love at first sight and love last's forever and ever and ever and happily ever after the audience cheers and women set aside their fears and believe that this is life and so dreams of being some man's wife become the antidote to all their strife!And the sickness of the lie just hit's me now, and as I say goodbye I wonder how. How did I deceive my own mind and believe that this guy was all I had to find in this world?"

Then each star was nothing But a promise from him. For his promise to her was broken. The girl closed her fist Around the glittering glass, Ignored the blood That was dripping from her hand.

The end of the world doesn’t exist,For that’s where all the hopes go…One day I’ll hold onto my hopes, And follow the thing until it lands with the man I’m meant to love. To say that I don’t believe in fate Would be to say that I don’t breath At all. Maybe the world is a big ocean That I will drown in. Or maybe a desertWhere I’ll die from thirst. Too much or too little can kill youEither way. Why do I speak of love When I’m incapable to love? I have to stop hoping, Only the fool believes that prayers are answeredAnd only the fool loves the hardest For the fool believes in happy ever after. Cinderella died just like you and me, And the fair prince lived on. We look too much on the way things are Instead of the way things will be. I want to be loved…Is that my big crime?

746,1.0,"Beautiful girl lost her way back in the day. Trying to follow footsteps of a lost mind, wants to go back,  is trapped in her own imagination.
 Covers her soul with a dirty mask, stains her body with the art of her mind. Draws one line down her face, broken heart between her breasts. Drops of black Inc run down her hand.
 She closes her eyes, trying to see what was meant to be.  Riding a wave, singing a tune, into the sky. Off she goes, living a dream. Endless colours swimming around, making a sound. Red and blue to see what is true, yellow and green to see what it means, purple and pink to see what to think.
 No mind of her own, fire inside. She sees the passion but can´t put it away. Counting on her fingers. Three, six, four, nine, I want to make you mine. Two, five, seven, zero, I want to be a hero.
 She paints a picture using her voice. Using a colour not of her choice. One line down and she makes a crown, making a kingdom of her own. Dancing around, nowhere to be found. Spreads her wings up to the sky. She is ready to fly and say goodbye.

 I love my crib the most I’m still representing the west side coast I love you my friend and I got your back So if anybody steps up to me, there’s no way back Don’t judge me before you know me No telling how far I’ll go Nothing I can do, my brain just goes with the flow It was in high school when my anger started to grow Now I can’t do this anymore My life isn’t like it was before One day you open the door and see me still hanging in the ceiling It’s not like anybody cares about my feeling
 You know what? This is kind of funny Chances of anybody reading this are the same like if I get any money Nobody cares, nobody reads about my shit Don’t tempt me to kill myself; I might as well do it I hate everybody that barks at me I hate everybody that won’t let me be Pimp haters, all around I can’t even go to town Pimp haters are making me feeling down One last word My name will always be the biggest name you’ve heard"

 The wind strokes my cheeks
 The leaves whirl by I whirl with the leaves
 My naked body remains
 Without thought, without soul, without feeling
 Bereft
 I am in another world
 But my body is in its right place
 I try to collect my thoughts
 My naked body running between the trees
 I lose connection with myself
 My body runs and runs
 But where is the soul
 I gather myself
 I see the body lying in the grass
 My own body
 My body is dead
 The soul flies up
 Often I have not seen the autumn
 But I save the memories"

 I try to brake it, crack it, defrost it. Nothing! Desolate isolation intense despair.
 Bright light raging heat playfulness joy and laughter temperature rising starstruck eyes the earth awakens
 My glacier crying, shaking. Breath of life roaring thunder a flowering rose
 Birds flying singing I´m crying. Shackles of old gone no more cold
 Frost retreating streams are forming runing gently in a single path power building earth erupting volcano showing
 rainbow and butterflies the song of whales sweet sound of water walls crumbling down The sun rising everything awakes
 I smile I laugh having fun the world is different brighter more colourful feeling lighter can I fly?
 I stand up flap my wings and slowly very slowly I rise above the ground climbing ever so slowly towards my sun towards my lifegiver towards happiness towards you?"

 And as I’m floating on free air, I scream and yell, in quite despair. Don’t know what will happen now, Will I ever get back down? Someone will probably think its fair, But it’s too much for me to bear. So I loose my grip and fall to the ground I fall and I fall forever it seems,  I finally come down, and I fell to my death,
 Would they laugh? Would they cry? Would they even notice I died? 
 Earth to earth, and dust to dust.
 Now I lie here, beneath the ground, To warm me, only the dirt, Thinking: I finally got out, From the pain, and the sorrow, And now, there is no tomorrow. Here, only peace and quiet,  And I said to myself as there I lay, Here I will stay, Forever, and have nothing to pay."

 I want to help her, I really do, I want it so bad, But only to see her face, It makes me sad.
 I see her crying, And she’s screaming for help, But no one will ever even try, And that’s why, I cry.
 I try to run over to her, But don’t want to come to close, I just stood there, looked at her, And my body just froze.
 Couldn’t do anything, I couldn’t move, I couldn’t stand, This is a feeling,  and it’s a quite new brand.
 To me, a feeling, That is really something new, And it’s not so appealing, From my heart, all emotions, is stealing.
 I want to run to her, Tell the kids to go away, Tell her it’s ok, Then I look around, and where are they?
 I stand up, And I run as fast as I can, But it still was too late, Oh how fast I ran.
 Sleeping beauty,  Lying on the ground, Move less, Wide open eyes, big and round.
 I see no movement, And I hear no sound, Only a puddle of blood, That begins to grow.
 Tears fill my eyes, And the hater begins to grow, How can these damn kids, Lay so low?"

She had more color than could be, Now black swallows all sanity. She had hidden sorrow in her heart, With so much to break apart. She left for a more peaceful place. In our hearts she has a space. When the darkness covers all light, Pain makes a never-ending night. Seems like the light will never return, Like this feeling will always burn. As when the clouds part after rain, Only time can ease your pain. The color will come back someday, In your heart the rainbow will stay, Her love will be with you forever, To grow with and to treasure."

 My dearest dream angel, Please come again. Please. Come again...
 I want to fall asleep  and sleep forever more, just for the chance to see you again."

 She tells me I'm disgusting, in my innocense I believe. And my self-esteem starts drowning, till I no longer want to live.
 But then one day I wake up, like from an ugly dream And I shout at the girl, 'shut up!' and to my surprise I see, that the girl there in the mirror, is noone else but me. and angry I break the mirror into a thousand-and-one piece."

Then she slowly falls asleep, and the light that brightens the sky in the day, she lends to the moon and the stars. The sky grows darker, the colour of the darkest of blue, it's like satin or silk. It's the same colour as I see when I look into your eyes, and I see the moonlight's reflect."

How often have I wished that you were here with me, and not so many miles away as you are? And how often have I written a poem about love, -with only you in my mind?
 I just can't get you out of my head; your voice, and your touch. I lie in my bed and feel like a part of me is missing,  And I feel that you're supposed to be there. It's like my heart was torn in two parts, and one part isn't here. An emptyness is surrounding my heart, It hurts and I let out a tear.
 I need to find the other part, and I think I know where to look. I think you have a half of my heart;  at least my whole mind you took."
1054,309.0,"What is this feeling I´m sensing? I´ve never felt it before. Sometimes I feel like I´m walking, or floating in the air.
 I feel almost overly happy, but miserable at the same time. I feel like I really want to..... oh damn couldn´t finish that line..
 Cause I can´t think straight, and I cant think askew......I think I´m in love with you.... 
 Sometimes I feel like I wanna give up, for this world doesn´t matter to me. Yeah, nothing really matters to me, unless there´s you, and there´s me.
 This feeling is filling my heart, and I think it´s gonna explode. But getting through the everyday-life is pretty hard, when I can´t stop thinking about you..
 But just to think about telling you how I feel, gives my stomach a butterfly,  Cause what would I do if you wouldn´t feel the same? And if this feeling dies...
 Because this feeling is what is keeping me alive, and the picture of you in my head, is enough for me to think that life on this earth, is a pretty good life to live."

 When I’m supposed to feel so good, and life is going well, I’m in love with you, and you love me as well, When life seems to be like the children’s play This unexpected feeling, I feel my decay
 This unexpected feeling is the loathing of life, Life and all that follows, the love and the strife. And only when you touch me and gently kiss my lips, This unexpected feeling is taken over by a bliss."

 Eyes in the dark, like tiny stars. Always watching, always hating. Always whispering - what do they say? She can't hear them, and she doesn't want to. Lies down, covers her ears, only to hear more whispering. This time the whispering comes from within her own head.

The sheets of my bed are marked by his footstep and do not wish to go away. Under my covers where you make me feel , under your covers where you make me real. Dose his breath weaken as the days go by? Have my linger strokes fallen to point of being forgotten. Or dose he remember the way I stroke his forehead into sleep and curved his hair away from his face, dose he sleep with his face against the wall still or is it filled with roses and sweet smell of flowers that warm his thoughts of days to come. Has he succeeded in the art of imitation of life and has he reached the place where his heart is no longer the prison of inhaling dreamless dreams. Do I regret the unsaid, the tango of two, and the eyes of you. Were ever you may be, who ever you might be the far well has deserted me. Since these are the last breath of you, when life offers you a chance to live, never regret having it."

 All this passion in my mind, lights this fire inside of me, suddendly we don\'t need the sunrise, caus suddendly we don\'t need to see, all we need is speed, all we need is neel and pease, caus today we build our life on poision, so our hearts wount bleed, so finally our minds get free..

 Watch the rain fall down as you run, feel this freedom rushing through your veins, caus you don\'t have to cry no more, now there our tears are dry, caus all we cried for, was just another last lie, and now our lifes\'re gone, now it\'s all gone..

 Then I found my hand of brave, then I fealt my heart again, I fealt so save, no more mourning - no more pain, I stapped the dark, I ran away, you fixed my broken wings, and you turned me back, you held me in your arms, and for the first time, I found love..
 But something happened, happily ever after faild, and for that - I felt so sad, all I felt was empty and guild, all I saw was you so mad, our dark times took over, we broke apart, and we got lost in nowhere..
 I wrote your name in thousand lines, I screamd your name like thousand times, I ran, I cried, I wrote down lies, I cuted me until I found a life, but something was missing, something was lost, I lost the only thing, there could give me love ..
